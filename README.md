# Wrangling and Analyzing WeRateDogs Twitter Dataset

## Introduction
Real-world data rarely comes clean and WeRateDogs Twitter data is one of those datasets.WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. I gathered additional data by querying the Twitter API for each tweet's JSON data using Python's [Tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/) library and store each tweet's entire set of JSON data in a file called `tweet_json.txt` file.

## Data wrangling process
Once I had all the three dataset, I assessed each dataset, document quality and tidiness issues, then cleaning each issue using `define`,`code` and `test` method. Then stored the data.

## Analyzing and Visualization
I visualized the cleaned data and documented insights and then created a report describing the data wrangling process and communicating the findings.
